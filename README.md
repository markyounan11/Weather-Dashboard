Description:

This application allows a user to input the name of a city and get back weather data about the inputted city such as current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. There is also a 5-day forecast that is appended to the screen for the specific city.
The cities the user inputs are saved as a list in local storage and can be referenced with ease. If the user clicks the available 'clear' button, the weather information along with the 5-day forecast are cleared off the page and the user can make a new search entry. The user can also switch between cities they've already searched with the most recently clicked-on city being the one whose information is displayed on the browser screen.





Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- moment.js
- AJAX
- Open Weather Map API





Coding Process and Challenges:

I used the skills I learned in class to create this app. These newly acquired skills include making AJAX calls to the API and understanding how moment.js is used to dynamically manipulate the date. I developed this application with the help of my cousin Mina Messak, who is a Senior Software Engineer who works on the back end at DocuSign. He guided me through the process of grabbing HTML elements and using JavaScript to manipulate them dynamically.

Making the AJAX calls was challenging at first but later made sense after I understood how to target items in the array of objects in the API. I had to constantly keep checking for errors in the browser console to make sure I was doing it correctly. Whenever I got stuck, I'd talk to Mina and he'd make me talk out my code line by line and ask myself questions about what exactly it is that I am trying to achieve.
